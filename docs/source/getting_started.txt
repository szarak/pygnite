Getting started
===============

Installation
------------

To install Pygnite get sources first.

    `Stable version <http://github.com/pagenoare/pygnite/zipball/0.1.2>`_

    `Unstable version (from git) <http://github.com/pagenoare/pygnite/zipball/master>`_

Next, unzip it and goto terminal. Type (from root)::

   python setup.py install

Yeah, pygnite is on your system now.

First application
-----------------

Now, we're going to create a simple one-file application. First open
hello.py and
type::

   from pygnite import *

It'll import pygnite. Next::

   @get('^/$')
   def index(request):
       return 'Hello world'

We've created simple index function, which takes param request, and it's
decorated by ``get`` from pygnite. It means it'll be "shown" only at / when
HTTP method is GET. 

The final step is to run pygnite dev server, add::

   pygnite()

at the end and run script::

   python hello.py

First application done! Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:6060 and
you should see
``Hello world``.
